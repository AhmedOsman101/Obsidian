### 4. **RAM (Memory)**: **Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4-3200**
   - **Reason**: 16GB is the sweet spot for modern gaming, and the 3200 MHz speed is optimal for Ryzen processors. The dual-channel setup (2x8GB) also improves performance compared to a single 16GB stick.
   - **Function**: RAM is a short-term memory where data needed by the CPU and GPU is temporarily stored. Faster RAM improves the efficiency of data transfer, which translates to smoother gameplay, especially in games that are memory-intensive.

---

### 5. **Storage**: **Crucial P3 1TB NVMe SSD**
   - **Reason**: The Crucial P3 is a fast NVMe SSD with ample space for both your OS and games. NVMe drives have much faster read/write speeds compared to traditional hard drives and even SATA SSDs, making load times noticeably faster.
   - **Function**: Storage is where your data is kept. An NVMe SSD like this one significantly reduces game loading times, enhances system boot-up speed, and makes the overall experience snappier than traditional storage.

---

### 6. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**: **EVGA 600 W1, 80+ White 600W**
   - **Reason**: This 600W PSU provides enough power for all the components, with a bit of headroom for future upgrades. It’s 80+ White certified, ensuring efficient power delivery without generating excessive heat.
   - **Function**: The PSU converts electricity from the wall into a form your computer can use and distributes it to all the components. A good PSU is essential for system stability and prevents potential damage from power surges.

---

### 7. **Case**: **NZXT H510**
   - **Reason**: The NZXT H510 has good airflow, is easy to build in, and has a minimalist design. It also comes with two pre-installed fans, saving additional costs on cooling.
   - **Function**: The case houses all components and keeps them cool and protected. Good airflow is essential for maintaining stable temperatures, which prolongs the lifespan of your components and ensures they run efficiently.

---

### 8. **CPU Cooler (Optional)**: **Cooler Master Hyper 212**
   - **Reason**: The Ryzen 5 5600X does come with a stock cooler, but the Hyper 212 provides better cooling, which is useful for those who want to keep temperatures low or plan to overclock their CPU.
   - **Function**: A cooler removes heat from the CPU to keep it operating at optimal temperatures. A more efficient cooler like the Hyper 212 can help the CPU maintain high performance under load, especially in gaming.
