## 1.1 Personal Computer

### Computer Definition

A **computer** can be defined as:

1. **Person:**  
   A person who performs calculations, often with a calculating machine.

2. **Programmable Device:**  
   A device capable of **storing**, **retrieving**, and **processing** data.

3. **Electronic Device:**  
   An electronic device that processes, stores, retrieves, and outputs data, typically in **binary form**, based on instructions from a variable program.

4. **Mathematical & Logical Operations:**  
   A programmable electronic device designed to **accept data**, perform **mathematical** and **logical** operations, store data, and **display results**.

**Types of computers** include:  
- **Mainframes**  
- **Desktops**  
- **Laptops**  
- **Tablets**  
- **Smartphones**  
- **Smartwatches**  
- **IoT devices**

### **Basic Personal Computer System**

- A **computer system** comprises both **hardware** and **software** components.

#### **Hardware:**
- The **physical equipment** of a computer system, including:
  - Case
  - Storage drives
  - Keyboards
  - Monitors
  - Cables
  - Speakers
  - Printers

#### **Software:**
- The **operating system** and **programs**:
  - The **operating system** instructs the computer on how to operate.
  - **Programs** or **applications** perform various functions.

## 1.2 PC Components

### Cases
- The **case** houses the internal components such as:
  - **Power supply**
  - **Motherboard**
  - **CPU** (Central Processing Unit)
  - **Memory**
  - **Disk drives**
  - Assorted **adapter cards**
- Case types include: 
  - **Super tower**
  - **Full tower**
  - **Mid-tower**
  - **Mini tower**
  - **Cube case**, and more.

### Power Supplies

- Provides **power** to all computer components.
- Must be chosen based on **current** and **future needs**.
- Delivers different **voltage levels** for various internal components.
- Converts **AC power** from the wall socket into low-voltage **DC power**.
- Must provide **sufficient power** for current and future additions.
- Has an **input voltage selector** on the back.
- Measured in **Wattage**.
- **Ohmâ€™s Law:**  
  - **W = V x A** (Watts = Volts x Amps)

### Connectors

- A power supply includes several different connectors, used to power various internal components like the motherboard and disk drives.
- The number of connectors varies based on the wattage of the power supply.

**Some examples include:**
- **20-pin or 24-pin main power connector**
- **SATA keyed connector** (for hard drives and SSDs)
- **Molex keyed connector** (for older hard drives, optical drives, and fans)
- **Berg keyed connector** (used for powering floppy drives, now mostly obsolete)
- **4-pin to 8-pin auxiliary power connector** (additional power to the CPU, also known as the ATX12V connector)
- **6/8-pin PCIe power connector** (supplies power to high-performance graphics cards)

## Power Supply Voltage

- Power supply connectors provide various **voltages**.
- The most common voltages are **3.3 volts**, **5 volts**, and **12 volts**.
- **3.3V** and **5V** supplies are generally used by **digital circuits** like the **CPU**, **RAM**, and **chipset** on the motherboard.
- The **12V** supply is typically used to power **motors** in disk drives and **fans**.
- Power supplies can be **single rail**, **dual rail**, or **multi rail**:
  - A **rail** is the **printed circuit board (PCB)** inside the power supply to which the external cables connect.
  - Often referred to as a **Modular Power Supply**.
- Computers can tolerate minor power fluctuations, but significant deviations can cause power supply failure.
