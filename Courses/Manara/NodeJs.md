# Backend Engineering with Node.js

## Introduction to Node.js

### What is backend?

In web development, applications are typically divided into two main parts: the client-side (front-end) and the server-side (backend).

**The Client-Side (Frontend):** This is what users interact with directly in their web browsers. It includes everything the user sees and interacts with, such as the layout, buttons, forms, and other elements that make up a web page. Technologies commonly used for client-side development include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. **The client-side is all about the look and feel** of a website and how it responds to user actions.

**The Server-Side (Backend):** The backend is like the brain behind the scenes of a web application. It handles the application’s logic, database interactions, user authentication, server configurations, and more. It’s what powers the application, making sure everything works smoothly. The server-side is built using languages like NodeJS, Python, Ruby, Java, and others, depending on the specific needs of the application.
