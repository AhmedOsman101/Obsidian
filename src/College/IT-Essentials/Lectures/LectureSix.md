## 5.2 Networking Protocols, Standards, and Services

### Reference Models

Reference models, such as the **OSI** and **TCP/IP** models, describe data communication processes.

- **Open Standards**:

  - Developed by organizations like IEEE, IETF, and ISO.
  - Ensure interoperability across systems and platforms.

- **Encapsulation**:
  - As application data moves down through layers, protocol information is added (headers, footers, etc.).

---

### TCP/IP Model

- **Purpose**:
  - Framework for the Internetâ€™s protocols.
  - Organizes networking tasks into layers.
  - Layers prepare data for network transmission.

**Layers:**

| Layer          | Description                                            | Protocols                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Application    | Provides network services to user applications         | HTTP, HTML, Telnet, FTP, TFTP, SMTP, DNS |
| Transport      | End-to-end data management and segmentation            | TCP, UDP                                 |
| Internet       | Provides host connectivity, routing, and IP addressing | IP, ICMP, RIP, ARP                       |
| Network Access | Handles MAC addressing and physical transmission       | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP                     |

---

### OSI Model

- **Purpose**:

  - Divides network communications into seven layers.
  - Used as a standard framework by most network vendors.
  - Combines **hardware** (lower layers) and **software** (higher layers) implementations.

- **Protocol Stack**:
  - Can be implemented in hardware, software, or both.
  - Lower layers often in hardware; higher layers in software.

#### Real-World Example (Email Transmission)

1. **Application Layer**: Email client uses SMTP to send an email.
2. **Presentation Layer**: Formats email data to be usable by the Application layer and ensures proper encryption, and compression of data.
3. **Session Layer**: Establishes a session between sender and recipient.
4. **Transport Layer**: Divides data into segments; ensures reliability via TCP.
5. **Network Layer**: Routes data across networks using IP.
6. **Data Link Layer**: Frames data with MAC addresses for local delivery.
7. **Physical Layer**: Transmits data as electrical signals or Wi-Fi.

**Layers:**

| No. | Layer        | Description                                                                                    | Protocols                               |

- **Steps**:
  1. **Data**: Original information from the application.
  2. **Segments**: Data divided and prepared by Transport layer.
  3. **Packets**: Segments are assigned IP addressing by Network layer.
  4. **Frames**: Packets framed with MAC addresses by Data Link layer.
  5. **Bits**: Data transmitted as raw signals (binray) via Physical layer.

## 5.5 Network Topologies

### Types of LAN Topologies

#### Physical Topology

- Defines the physical layout of network components.

#### Logical Topology

- Determines how hosts access the medium for communication.

---

### Logical Topologies

- **Broadcast Topology**:
  - Hosts broadcast messages to all hosts on the same network segment.
  - No specific transmission order; messages sent on a FIFO basis.
  - Used in Ethernet networks.
- **Token Passing**:
  - Network access controlled by sequentially passing a token.
  - Only the host with the token can transmit data.

### LAN Physical Topologies

- **Bus**:
  - A single central cable connects all devices.
  - Only one device transmits at a time; collisions destroy frames.
- **Ring**:
  - Hosts connected in a circular pattern; uses tokens for data transmission.
  - Each device connects to two others
  - Variants: Single-ring and Dual-ring.
- **Star**:
  - Central connection point (hub, switch, or router).
  - Simplifies troubleshooting; independent connections for each device.
- **Hierarchical (Extended Star)**:
  - Additional devices extend a star topology to support larger networks.
- **Mesh**:
  - Every device is connected to all (full) or to multiple devices (partial)
  - High reliability; used in WANs and high-availability systems.
- **Hybrid**:
  - Combines two or more topologies, such as star-bus or star-ring.

| Hybrid        | Combination of topologies            | Depends on design             | Flexible                  | Varies   | Diverse environments               |

## Types of Networks

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Connects devices in a limited area (home/office).
- **WLAN (Wireless LAN)**: Wireless connection via access points; copper cabling connects access points.
- **VLAN (Virtual LAN)**: Logical network segmentation for management, security, and performance.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Connects personal devices (e.g., Bluetooth for keyboards, phones, etc.).
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Covers a campus or city, using wireless or fiber backbones.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Interconnects smaller networks (e.g., the Internet).

## Network Architectures

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks

- Decentralized; each device acts as both client and server.
- No centralized administration; all peers manage their own resources.
- Limited scalability; performance decreases as peers increase.
- Low setup cost; no need for expensive servers.
- Less secure; each device is responsible for its own security.
- Less reliable; if a peer goes offline, its resources are unavailable.
- Slower as the network grows; depends on peer resources.
- Easier maintainance; no central device to manage.
- Used in file-sharing networks (e.g., BitTorrent).
- Data storage is distributed across peers.

### Client-Server Networks

- Centralized server manages resources and security.
- Centralized control by the server.
- Higher setup cost due to the need for dedicated servers.
- Highly scalable; servers can handle many clients.
- More secure; centralized measures can be implemented.
- More reliable; servers provide consistent availability.
- Faster; optimized server hardware ensures efficiency.
- Data storage is centralized on the server; clients access shared data.
- Requires skilled admins to manage servers.
- Used in large networks (e.g., corporate systems, web apps).
- Examples include: Websites, enterprise systems (e.g., Google Drive).
