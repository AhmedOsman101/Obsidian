## Computer Basics: Software & Hardware

### Hardware

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, which include:

- **Case**: Encloses and protects internal components.
- **Storage Drives**: Store data and programs.
- **Keyboard & Monitor**: Input and output devices for user interaction.
- **Cables, Speakers, and Printers**: Additional peripherals for connectivity and multimedia.

### Software

Software includes the operating system (OS) and various programs or applications:

- **Operating System**: Instructs the computer on how to operate and manage hardware.
- **Programs or Applications**: Perform specific tasks or functions, such as word processing or browsing.

## Computer Language

Computers communicate through electrical signals, processed in the binary system, which is the fundamental language for computing.

### Binary System

The binary system uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent all data. Binary data is grouped as follows:

- **Nibble**: 4 bits.
- **Byte**: 8 bits.
- **Word**: 16 bits (2 Bytes).

### Conversion Practice

#### Decimal to Binary Conversion

Convert decimal numbers to binary with the specified number of bits:

- **6** to binary (4 bits): `0110`
- **17** to binary (4 bits): `10001`
- **57** to binary (8 bits): `00111001`
- **257** to binary (8 bits): `100000001`

#### Binary to Decimal Conversion

Convert binary numbers to decimal:

- `0110`: 6
- `10110111`: 183
