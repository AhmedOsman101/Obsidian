# IT Essentials Lab 2: Computer Assembly

## Power Supply

The power supply converts electrical power from an outlet (AC) into usable power (DC) for the internal components of the computer.

## Motherboard

The motherboard is the computer's main circuit board. It includes several essential components:

- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Executes instructions and processes data.
- **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: Temporary memory for active tasks.
- **Read Only Memory (ROM)**: Stores permanent data for system functions.
- **Cooling Components**:
  - **Fans**: Release the heat from the motherboard.
  - **Heat Sink**: Draws heat away from the CPU.
- **Expansion Slots**: For additional hardware.
- **Chipset**: Controls communication between CPU, memory, and peripherals.

## BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)

BIOS is firmware that initializes hardware during the boot process (power-on startup). It is the first software to run upon powering on the system. Access the BIOS setup by pressing keys such as F1, F2, F10, Del, or Esc.

## Cooling System

- **Heat Sink**: Directly attached to the CPU to absorb and release the heat.
- **Fan**: Mounted above the heat sink to further cool down the CPU.

## CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The CPU, also called the processor, is the brain of the computer. It fits into a socket on the motherboard, with two primary types:

- **Pin Grid Array (PGA)**: Pins on the CPU connect to holes in the socket.
- **Land Grid Array (LGA)**: Pins are located on the socket, and the CPU has flat contact points.

## Memory Types

- **Read-Only Memory (ROM)**: Non-volatile memory that permanently stores essential data.
- **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: Volatile memory used to temporarily store data for active processes.

## Storage

- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: A traditional, electro-mechanical data storage device with spinning disks.
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: A faster, more durable storage option with no moving parts, up to 5x faster than HDDs.
- **M.2 SSD**: An advanced storage interface utilizing PCI Express, ideal for high-speed storage.

## Expansion Slots and Adapter Cards

Expansion slots allow for adding hardware to the motherboard:

- **PCI**: Peripheral Component Interconnect.
- **AGP**: Advanced Graphics Port.
- **Mini PCI**: Commonly used in laptops.

**Adapter Cards**:

- **Video Card**: Enhances graphical performance.
- **NIC (Network Interface Card)**: For wired network connectivity.
- **Wireless NIC**: For wireless network connectivity.

## Software Installation

- **Baidu Spark Browser**: Install for specific browsing needs.
- **IT Essentials Virtual Desktop**: Install for lab and practical applications.

## Computer Assembly Steps

1. **Open the Case**.
2. **Install the Power Supply**.
3. **Attach Components**: Connect CPU, RAM, and other components to the motherboard.
4. **Install Motherboard**: Secure the motherboard in the case.
5. **Install Internal and External Drives**: Add HDDs, SSDs, optical drives, etc.
6. **Install Adapter Cards**: Add video, network, or other adapter cards.
7. **Connect Internal Cables**: Power, data, and peripheral cables.
8. **Reattach Side Panels**: Close the case and connect external cables for monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.
