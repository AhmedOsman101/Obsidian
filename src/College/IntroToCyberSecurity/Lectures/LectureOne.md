# Introduction To Cybersecurity Lecture 1

## What's Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the protection of information systems (hardware, software, and network), the data on them, and the services they provide, from these items:

- Unauthorized access
- General harm or misuse
- Harm caused intentionally by the operator of the system
- Accidentally as a result of failing to follow security procedures.

### The History of Cybersecurity

#### 1970s: ARPANET and the Creeper

In the **1970s**, cybersecurity emerged with the creation of the **Creeper** program by **Bob Thomas**, which could move across **ARPANET**, leaving a trail behind. **Ray Tomlinson**, who **invented email**, **developed Reaper**, a program designed to chase and delete Creeper. Reaper became **the first example of antivirus software** and **the first self-replicating program**, marking it as **the first computer worm**.

#### 1980s: Birth of the commercial antivirus

In **1987**, commercial antivirus software emerged with several competing claims for the first product. **Andreas LÃ¼ning** and **Kai Figge** developed an antivirus for the **Atari ST**, along with the release of **Ultimate Virus Killer**. Meanwhile, three **Czechoslovakians** introduced the first version of the **NOD antivirus**. In the **US**, **John McAfee founded McAfee** and **launched VirusScan**, marking a significant step in the evolution of cybersecurity.

#### 1990s: The world goes online

As the internet became accessible to the public, more personal information was shared online, attracting organized crime to steal data from individuals and governments. By the **mid-1990s**, the rise in network security threats led to a surge in the **production of firewalls and antivirus software** to protect users on a large scale.

#### 2000s: Threats diversify and multiply

In the **early 2000s**, crime organizations began heavily **funding professional cyber-attacks**, prompting governments to impose **stricter penalties for hacking**. As the internet expanded, information security advanced, but viruses continued to evolve alongside it.

#### 2021: The next generation

The cybersecurity industry is rapidly expanding, with the global market expected to grow significantly by 2026. Ransomware remains one of the most prevalent threats to organizational data security and is projected to continue increasing.

### The importance of cybersecurity

In today's digital age, cybersecurity is crucial as **a single breach can expose millions of people's personal information**, causing **financial losses** and **eroding customer trust**. Hence, cybersecurity is essential to **protect businesses and individuals** from **spammers and cybercriminals**. Cybersecurity protects various types of data (**8 types**), including **sensitive information**, **personally identifiable information** (PII), **protected health information** (PHI), **intellectual property**, and **governmental data**. Without a robust cybersecurity program, organizations become vulnerable to breaches, making them prime targets for cybercriminals.

The risk of successful cyber attacks and data breaches is rising due to widespread **poor cloud service configurations** and **increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals**. **Business leaders can no longer rely solely on basic cybersecurity solutions like antivirus software and firewalls**, as **cybercriminals are adapting** their tactics to overcome conventional defenses. Comprehensive coverage of all cybersecurity aspects is essential for protection. Additionally, both inherent and residual risks are growing due to global connectivity and the use of cloud services, such as **Amazon Web Services** (AWS), for storing sensitive data.

As organizations increasingly adopt digital transformation, **the risk of cybercrime is rising** rapidly, making **IT infrastructure crucial for defense against cyberattacks**. **Data breaches now affect all industries**, not just highly regulated sectors like healthcare, and even small businesses face the risk of severe reputational damage. **Businesses**, **individuals**, **and governments are heavily investing in cybersecurity** to protect assets and data from **hackers**. To thrive in today's competitive environment, businesses need the right cybersecurity tools and strategies.
