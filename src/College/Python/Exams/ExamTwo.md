# Python Assignment Two

## Scenario

You are applying for the position of a programmer in the Department of Computer Science and Systems at New Cairo Technological University.
The director has assigned the following tasks:

- Test your understanding of Python programming's fundamental ideas and subjects.
- Assess whether you can approach challenges with "software engineer thinking" to find the optimal solution.

## Task 1

Write a Python program using `elif` to take a student's grade as input, with the grade ranging from 0 to 100. The program should determine the student's grade category based on the following criteria:

- **Excellent**: 85 or higher, up to 100.
- **Very Good**: 75 or above but less than 85.
- **Good**: 65 or above but less than 75.
- **Acceptable**: 60 or above but less than 65.
- **Fail**: Less than 60.

If the input value is outside the range of 0 to 100, the program should display an error message indicating that the supplied value is invalid.

## Task 2

Mention the differences between `while` loop and `for` loop.

## Task 3

Repeat the program from Task 1 to use loops, allowing the program to run repeatedly an unlimited number of times. The program should only stop when the user enters `exit` (case-insensitive).

> [!Note]
> Solve this task without using functions.

## Task 4

Create a program that entertains workers recording studentsâ€™ grades during their break. The program should ask the user to enter the number of lines needed to print the following shape:

```
*
**
***
```

Use loops to allow the program to run repeatedly an unlimited number of times. The program should only stop when the user enters `exit` in lowercase letters.

> Solve this task without using functions.

## Task 5: Define lists and tuples and compare between them

## Task 6: Define the dictionary in Python and mention its uses

## Task 7: Re-write task 3 with using function

## Task 8: Write program using a dictionary to store student name and degree data

## Task 9

Write a program using a dictionary to store student names and their grades for four subjects. The program should accept the student's name and grades as input. Each subject has a maximum score of 100 marks. The program should calculate and output the total score and classify the student's general grade according to the following criteria:

- **Excellent**: 85% or higher, up to 100%.
- **Very Good**: 75% or above but less than 85%.
- **Good**: 65% or above but less than 75%.
- **Acceptable**: 60% or above but less than 65%.
- **Fail**: Less than 60%.

> [!Note]
> Use all the notes mentioned above and apply everything you have learned, including control structures, functions, and lists.
