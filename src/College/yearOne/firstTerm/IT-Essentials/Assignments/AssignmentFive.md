# Task Five

## Hardware Requirements for Windows 11

### 1. Minimum Requirements for Windows 11

- **processor**: **1 gigahertz (GHz)** or faster with 2 or more cores on a [compatible 64-bit processor](http://aka.ms/CPUlist) or System on a Chip **(SoC)**.
- **RAM**: 4 gigabytes (GB)
- **Storage**: 64 GB or larger storage device.
- **System firmware**: [UEFI](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/uefi-vs-bios/#heading-uefi), Secure Boot capable.
- **Graphics card**: Compatible with DirectX 12 or later with WDDM 2.0 driver.
- **Display**: High definition (720p) display that is greater than 9 inches diagonally, 8 bits per color channel.
- **TPM (Trusted Platform Module)**: Version 2.0.
- **Internet connection and Microsoft account**

### 2. Recommended Hardware Upgrades

**a. CPU Upgrade**

- **Requirement**: A modern, 64-bit processor with at least two cores, such as an Intel Core i3 8th generation or newer, or AMD Ryzen 2000 series or newer.

- **Improvement**: Upgrading to a compatible CPU enhances overall system speed, multitasking capability, and compatibility with modern applications and security features.

**b. RAM Upgrade**

- **Requirement**: Increase RAM from 4GB to at least 8GB or 16GB.

- **Improvement**: Additional RAM allows the system to handle more applications simultaneously, reduces loading times, and improves performance for resource-intensive tasks like browsing, document editing, and media playback.

**c. Storage Upgrade**

- **Requirement**: Replace the existing storage with a 256GB SSD or 512GB (minimum).

- **Improvement**: SSDs provide faster boot times, quicker file access, and improved overall system responsiveness compared to traditional HDDs.

**d. GPU Compatibility Check**

- **Requirement**: Ensure the existing graphics card supports DirectX 12 and has a WDDM 2.0 driver.

- **Improvement**: A compatible GPU ensures smoother visuals, better video rendering, better gaming experience, and support for enhanced graphics features in Windows 11.

**e. TPM and Firmware Updates**

- **Requirement**: Install a compatible TPM 2.0 module and enable UEFI firmware settings and secure Boot in the BIOS if supported. If not available, consider upgrading the motherboard to one that supports these features.

- **Improvement**: These updates enhance system security, enabling features like Secure Boot and advanced encryption capabilities.

### 3. Additional Considerations

- **Power Supply**: Ensure the power supply unit (PSU) can handle the upgraded components.

- **Cooling System**: Verify adequate cooling solutions are in place to support new hardware.

- **Driver Updates**: Install the latest drivers for all hardware components to ensure stability and performance.
