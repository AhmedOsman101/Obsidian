# Introduction to Cybersecurity Lecture 8

## Principles of risk management in cybersecurity (Part II)

### 3. Risk Mitigation

- Implement security controls and best practices to protect against potential threats.
- Develop and implement policies, procedures, and guidelines for a culture of security awareness.
- Consider security technologies such as firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, encryption, and multi-factor authentication.

**Example**: Implementing encryption and access controls to protect patient health records.

### 4. Risk Monitoring and Review

- Establish ongoing monitoring and review of risk mitigation measures.
- Monitor for new threats and vulnerabilities through regular security assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration tests.
- Stay informed about emerging threats, security vulnerabilities, and best practices through threat intelligence feeds and industry publications.

**Example**: A technology company continuously monitoring its network traffic using intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) tools.

### 5. Risk Communication and Reporting

- Communicate risk findings and mitigation efforts to relevant stakeholders.
- Provide regular updates on security status, including incidents, breaches, or near misses.
- Ensure transparency in risk communication to support stakeholder trust.

**Example**: Communicating incident details to senior management, affected customers, and regulatory authorities.

### 6. Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

- Consider legal and regulatory requirements related to cybersecurity risk management.
- Ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards governing cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection.
- Stay informed about regulatory requirements and industry best practices to align with obligations.

**Example**: Ensuring compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) by implementing controls for customer payment card data.

### 7. Integration with Business Objectives

- Integrate risk management into overall business objectives.
- Align risk management strategies with business goals.
- Ensure security investments support business objectives.

**Example**: Aligning cybersecurity investments with business objectives of maintaining production uptime and protecting intellectual property.
