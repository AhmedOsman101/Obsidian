# Cybersecurity Essentials Lecture One

## What is a Network?

A **computer network** is a system that connects multiple independent computers and devices to share data and resources. It enables easier communication and collaboration among users.

- A network can be established using cable (wired) or wireless media.
- It uses both hardware and software to facilitate connections and operations.

### Types of Computer Networks

#### 1. Local Area Network (LAN)

- Most commonly used network type.
- Connects computers within a limited area (e.g., home, office, school).
- Range: Up to 2 km.
- High transmission speed, easy to maintain, and low cost.
- Example: Networking in libraries, labs, schools, and offices.

#### 2. Wide Area Network (WAN)

- Connects computers across large geographical distances.
- Not restricted to a single location.
- Essentially a group of LANs connected together.
- Range: Over 50 km.
- Low transmission speed, high maintenance, and high cost.
- Example: The Internet.

#### 3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

- Larger than LAN, smaller than WAN.
- Connects computers across a city or town.
- Range: 5 km to 50 km.
- Moderate transmission speed, high cost, and harder to maintain.
- Example: Networking within a city or across multiple buildings in a campus.

#### 4. Personal Area Network (PAN)

- Basic type of network used around a single person.
- Connects personal devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops.
- Range: 1 to 100 meters.
- High transmission speed, very low cost, and easy maintenance.
- Typically uses Bluetooth.
- Example: Connections between a phone and a Bluetooth headset or printer.

#### 5. Body Area Network (BAN) / Body Sensor Network (BSN) / Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)

- A system of low-power wearable or implanted devices operating around the human body.
- Communicates wirelessly and can transmit data via gateways to the Internet or base stations.
- Commonly used in healthcare to monitor patient data remotely.
- Uses technologies like WPAN for broader connectivity.

## What is Data Communication?

**Telecommunication** refers to communication over a distance, while **data communication** is the exchange of data between two devices using a transmission medium (e.g., cable or wireless).

### Characteristics of Effective Data Communication

1. **Delivery** – Data must reach the correct destination.
2. **Accuracy** – Data should be delivered without errors.
3. **Timeliness** – Data should be delivered in real-time (especially for audio/video).
4. **Jitter** – Variation in packet arrival time should be minimized.

## Network Criteria

- **Performance**: Evaluated by throughput and delay.
- **Reliability**: Includes accuracy, failure frequency, recovery time, and robustness.
- **Security**: Involves protecting data from unauthorized access, corruption, and implementing recovery measures.

## Network Devices

Network devices are hardware components that allow communication between computers and other devices on a network.

### Repeater

- Operates at the physical layer.
- Regenerates weak or corrupted signals to extend transmission distance.
- 2-port device used in star topologies.

### Hub

- Multiport repeater.
- Connects multiple devices in a network.
- Broadcasts data to all connected devices (no filtering or routing).
- Lacks efficiency and intelligent data forwarding.

### Bridge

- Operates at the data link layer.
- Filters traffic by MAC address and connects two or more LAN segments.
- Modern bridges are often called Layer 2 switches.

### Switch

- Multiport bridge with buffers for better efficiency.
- Operates at the data link layer.
- Performs error checking and forwards data only to the intended port.

### Router

- Operates at the network layer.
- Routes data based on IP addresses.
- Connects multiple networks (e.g., LAN to WAN).
- Divides broadcast domains and dynamically updates routing tables.

### Modem

- Stands for **modulator/demodulator**.
- Converts digital signals to analog (and vice versa) for transmission over telephone lines or cables.
- Commonly used for internet access via ISPs.

### Access Point (AP)

- Wireless networking device that connects wireless devices to a wired network.
- Creates Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).
- Useful in large offices and buildings to provide mobile access with reduced infrastructure cost.
