## Outline

### What is IoT?

- A world of interconnected things capable of sensing, actuating, and communicating among themselves and with the environment.
- A system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, or people with unique identifiers (UIDs), transferring data over a network without human intervention.

### Objectives of IoT

- Connecting devices, appliances, and machines
- Exchanging data and information
- Sensing, processing, controlling, actuating, and monitoring
- Providing services

### Major Components of IoT

1. **Sensors**: Collecting data
2. **Connectivity**: Sending data to the cloud
3. **Data Processing**: Making data useful
4. **User Interface**: Delivering information to users

### IoT Use Cases

- Smart Wearables
- Smart Home
- Smart City
- Smart Agriculture
- Connected Cars
- Healthcare
- Industrial Automation
- Smart Energy

## IoT Enabling Technologies

### Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

- Distributed devices with sensors monitoring environmental and physical conditions.
- A network formed by multiple sensor nodes detecting light, heat, pressure, etc.
- **The coordinator** collects data and acts as a **gateway** connecting WSN to the internet.

#### Examples of WSN Applications

- Indoor Air Quality Monitoring
- Weather Monitoring
- Soil Moisture Monitoring
- Surveillance Systems
- Health Monitoring

#### Wireless Communication Protocols for WSN

- **IEEE 802.15.4**: Low-power communication standard.
- **Zigbee**: Popular protocol for WSN, based on IEEE 802.15.4.
  - **Data rate:** Up to **250 KBps**
  - **Range:** Up to **100 meters**

## Cloud Computing & IoT

- A scalable distributed computing model delivering infrastructure, platforms, and software as services.
- **Advantages:**
  - Remote data access
  - Scalability
  - World-class service delivery
  - No hardware/software installation
  - Instant software updates

### Cloud Deployment Models

1. **Private Cloud**: Dedicated to a single organization.
2. **Public Cloud**: Shared with the general public.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of private and public clouds.
4. **Community Cloud**: Shared among organizations with similar interests.

### Cloud Service Models

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Hosted applications (e.g., Google Docs, Salesforce.com)
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Development platforms (e.g., Azure, Google App Engine)
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Computing resources (e.g., AWS, GoGrid)

## Big Data & IoT

- Large, complex datasets requiring specialized management and analytics techniques.

### Big Data Analytics

- **Data Cleansing**: Correcting, removing, replacing faulty data.
- **Data Wrangling**: Converting data formats.
- **Data Processing & Visualization**: Analyzing and presenting insights.

### Big Data Characteristics (3Vs)

1. **Volume**: Amount of generated data.
2. **Velocity**: Speed of data generation.
3. **Variety**: Different types of data (structured & unstructured).

### Real-time/Fast Data Sources

- Mobile devices (tracking objects)
- Social media (user-generated data)
- Scientific instruments (data collection)
- Sensor networks (environmental monitoring)

## Communication Protocols in IoT

- **Backbone of IoT systems**
- Define data exchange formats, encoding, addressing, and routing

### Functions of Communication Protocols
