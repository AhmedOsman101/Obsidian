## Introduction to Embedded Systems

A computing system consists of a processor, memory, and I/O peripherals. It is divided into:

- **General-purpose systems**: Designed for multiple applications.
- **Specific-purpose systems**: Designed for dedicated functions (embedded systems).

### Common Characteristics

- **Dependability**: Reliable operation.
- **Single-functioned**: Executes a single program repeatedly.
- **Tightly-constrained**: Low cost, low power, compact size, fast performance.
- **Reactive and Real-time**: Instantly responds to environmental changes with no delay.

### Embedded System Workflow

1. **Environment**: Provides real-world data.
2. **Sensors**: Collect environmental data.
3. **Analog-to-Digital Converter**: Converts sensor data into digital format.
4. **Embedded Computing**: Processes data using processors and memory.
5. **Output Data Flow**:
   - Sent to **Display** for visualization.
   - Sent to **Digital-to-Analog Converter** for actuator control.
6. **Actuators**: Interact with the environment based on processed data.

## Microprocessor (CPU)

A microprocessor is a single processor core that fetches, decodes, and executes instructions. It's suited for general-purpose computing but requires external memory (ROM/RAM), a memory decoder, an oscillator, and I/O ports to form a complete microcomputer.

### Microprocessor Architecture Workflow

1. **Instruction Fetcher**: Retrieves instructions from memory.
2. **Instruction Decoder**: Interprets instructions.
3. **Register Banks**: Store temporary data.
4. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs computations and logic operations.
5. **Memory Interface**: Manages data exchange with memory.

## Microcontroller

A microcontroller is a compact system-on-chip with an integrated CPU, memory (RAM, ROM), and programmable I/O peripherals, designed for specific tasks.

## Microprocessor vs. Microcontroller

| **Feature**           | **Microprocessor**                             | **Microcontroller**                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Usage**             | Computer systems and General-purpose computing | Embedded systems (e.g., appliances)     |
| **Components**        | CPU only; external RAM, ROM, I/O needed        | Contains CPU, RAM, ROM, and peripherals |
| **Circuit Size**      | Large and complex                              | Small and compact                       |
| **Power Consumption** | High                                           | Low                                     |
| **Registers**         | Few; relies on external memory (slower)        | Many; faster processing                 |

## What is Arduino?

Arduino is an open-source microcontroller-based prototyping board programmed using the Arduino IDE. It supports simplified C++ programming and is widely used in robotics, automation, and IoT projects.

## Different Types of Arduino

| **Arduino Board** | **Processor**     | **Memory**             | **Digital I/O** | **Analog I/O**     |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Arduino Uno       | 16MHz ATmega328   | 2KB SRAM, 32KB flash   | 14              | 6 input, 0 output  |
| Arduino Due       | 84MHz AT91SAM3X8E | 96KB SRAM, 512KB flash | 54              | 12 input, 2 output |
| Arduino Mega      | 16MHz ATmega2560  | 8KB SRAM, 256KB flash  | 54              | 16 input, 0 output |
| Arduino Leonardo  | 16MHz ATmega32u4  | 2.5KB SRAM, 32KB flash | 20              | 12 input, 0 output |

### Differences Between Arduino Boards

- **14 Digital I/O Pins** (6 support PWM for analog-like control)
- 6 Analog Inputs
- **6 Analog Inputs**
- **USB Connection**
- **Power Jack**
- **Reset Button**
- **On-board LED**
- **SCL/SDA Pins** (I2C communication and Serial Clock/Data)

It's self-containedâ€”connect via USB or power with an adapter/battery to start.

## Arduino Sensors

Sensors detect environmental changes (e.g., temperature, pressure, light) and convert them into electronic signals. The sensor data is recorded and processed by the Arduino.

## Arduino IDE

Arduino is programmed using the **Arduino IDE**, an open-source platform for writing and uploading code to Arduino boards. It supports:

- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Languages**: C, C++
- **File Extension**: `.ino`

Connect the board to the IDE via USB to upload code.

### Useful Functions

| **Function**     | **Description**                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `pinMode()`      | Sets pin as input or output            |
| `digitalWrite()` | Sets digital pin high/low              |
| `digitalRead()`  | Reads digital pin's state              |
| `analogRead()`   | Reads analog pin value                 |
| `analogWrite()`  | Writes PWM value (analog-like)         |
| `delay()`        | Pauses execution (in milliseconds)     |
| `millis()`       | Get the current time (in milliseconds) |

## Blinking LED Example

To implement a blinking LED using Arduino:

1. Connect an LED to a digital pin.
2. Use the Arduino IDE to write the following code:

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // Set pin 13 as output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // Turn LED ON
  delay(1000);            // Wait 1 second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);  // Turn LED OFF
  delay(1000);            // Wait 1 second
}
```

3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
4. The LED will blink every second.

## Getting Started with Arduino

### Requirements:

### Steps:

1. Install the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the Arduino board to the computer via USB.
3. Write and upload the code.
4. If you don't have an Arduino board, use **TinkerCAD** for simulation (see below).

## TinkerCAD for Arduino Simulation

**TinkerCAD Circuits** allows you to simulate Arduino projects before implementing them on real hardware.
