## Task 1

Using the following figure:
![](figure-1.png)

### Q1: Explain the below communication model.

**Push-Pull Communication Model:**

- **Producers push** data to **queues**, which act as an intermediary between producers and consumers.
- **Consumers pull** data from these queues at their own pace, enabling asynchronous communication.
- **Queues buffer** messages and handle mismatched data rates, allowing producers to continue sending data even when consumers are slower or temporarily unavailable.
- Producers and consumers are decoupled, meaning they do not need to know about each other's availability or state.

---

### Q2: State cloud computing service model and deployment models and explain them.

#### Cloud Service Models

Cloud computing offers three primary service models, each serving different needs:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:

  - Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., servers, storage, networking).
  - Example: Amazon EC2.
  - Explanation: Users rent infrastructure and manage their own operating systems and applications, offering flexibility but requiring more technical oversight.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:

  - Offers a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications without managing underlying infrastructure.
  - Example: Google App Engine.
  - Explanation: Ideal for developers, as it simplifies app development by providing pre-configured tools and environments.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
  - Delivers fully functional software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
  - Example: Google Workspace.
  - Explanation: End-users access software without installation or maintenance, making it convenient and cost-effective.

#### Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud deployment models define how cloud resources are hosted and accessed:

- **Public Cloud**:

  - Resources are shared among multiple users over the internet.
  - Example: AWS.
  - Explanation: Cost-effective and scalable, but less control over data security.

- **Private Cloud**:

  - Dedicated to a single organization, hosted on-site or by a provider.
  - Explanation: Offers greater security and customization, though at a higher cost.

- **Hybrid Cloud**:

  - Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them.
  - Explanation: Balances cost and security, ideal for dynamic workloads.

- **Community Cloud**:
  - Shared among organizations with similar needs (e.g., healthcare providers).
  - Explanation: Cost-sharing and tailored security make it suitable for niche groups.

### Q3: Compare between virtual machines and containers.

- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Emulate entire operating systems and run on a hypervisor. Each VM includes a full OS, making them heavier in terms of resource usage. They provide strong isolation and are ideal for running multiple different OS environments on a single physical machine.

- **Containers**: Share the host OS kernel and run isolated processes in user space. Containers are lightweight, start faster, and use fewer resources compared to VMs. They are ideal for microservices and scalable applications but offer slightly weaker isolation.

| Aspect             | Virtual Machines                                  | Containers                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **OS Support**     | Full OS per VM                                    | Shared host OS kernel                      |
| **Resource Usage** | Heavy, requires significant CPU, memory, storage. | Light, minimal overhead.                   |
| **Startup Time**   | Slower (minutes) due to OS boot.                  | Faster (seconds) as no OS boot is needed.  |
| **Isolation**      | Strong, each VM has its own OS.                   | Weaker, shares OS but isolates apps.       |
| **Use Case**       | Multi-OS, legacy apps                             | Microservices, cloud-native apps           |
| **Portability**    | Less portable due to full OS dependency.          | Highly portable with app and dependencies. |
| **Example**        | VMware VMs.                                       | Docker containers.                         |

**Summary**: VMs are robust and isolated but resource-intensive, while containers are efficient and fast, ideal for scalable IoT applications at SmartTech.

5. Repeat until centroids stabilize.

**Example**: Grouping IoT sensor data by usage patterns.

### Q10: Implement a One-Node Hadoop Cluster and Explain Hadoop Components, MapReduce, and Its Steps with Example

#### Hadoop: Single Node Installation on Arch Linux

**What is Apache Hadoop?**

Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows for distributed processing and storage of large datasets across clusters of computers. It provides a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for handling big data applications. Hadoop consists of two main components: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN).

HDFS is a distributed file system that stores data across multiple machines, providing high throughput access to large datasets. YARN is a resource management system that manages and schedules resources in a Hadoop cluster, enabling parallel processing of data.

##### Prerequisite Test

**Step 1 — Update the packages list**

Press open a Terminal then type the following command it will update the packages and it will ask the password type the user password which you used while login if you did not set a login password then just hit enter.

```shell
sudo pacman -Sy
```

**Step 2 — Install OpenJDK 8**

The command `sudo pacman -S jdk8-openjdk` is necessary for Hadoop because it installs the OpenJDK 8 Development Kit, which is a prerequisite for running Hadoop. Hadoop is a Java-based framework, and it requires a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) to execute its processes and applications

```shell
sudo pacman -S jdk8-openjdk
```

Verify it after installation by the following command

```shell
java -version; javac -version
```

![](figure-17.png)

**Step 3 — SSH Server and Client Packages**

This command is necessary for Hadoop as it installs the SSH server and client packages. These packages enable secure communication between Hadoop nodes in a distributed cluster, ensuring efficient data transfer and coordination

```shell
sudo pacman -S openssh
```

![](figure-18.png)

**Step 4 — Add a new user for Hadoop**

This step is not necessary but it is perferable to add a new user for the hadoop usage since many things can go wrong for you So it is always recommended to add a new User make sure to remember to username for this installtaion im using **hdoop** you can change the hdoop username to your perferable choice but remember you have to change username for the following commands if you have another username.

Name username to `hdoop`.

```shell
sudo useradd -m -s $(which bash) hdoop
```

Then add password after that hit enter.

```shell
sudo passwd hdoop
```

**Step 5— Add new user to the sudo group**

This step is necessary as it allows your new user to edit the changes without any errors.

```shell
sudo usermod -aG wheel hdoop
```

**Step 6— Switch to your new user**

Now we will switch to the new user so we can download the hadoop and setup it in that user just type the following command it will ask for the password which you set it will creating the new user in **4th Step.**

```shell
su - hdoop
```

As you can see we switch it to our hdoop user

**Step 7 — Genrate SSH key**

Copy the following commands in sequence it will genrate the SSH key

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id\_rsa

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys

ssh localhost
```

![](figure-19.png)
![](figure-20.png)

**Step 8 — Download Apache Hadoop**

you can download hadoop from the following website go to this website or just type Apache Hadoop download and go to the offical website

[hadoop.apache.org](https://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html)

Decide which version you want to install for this purpose im going to install 3.3.6

![](figure-21.png)

Now copy the below link of the version you selected

Copy this link and then go to terminal and type `wget <copied-link>` like this

```shell
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.6/hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz
```

![](figure-22.png)

Now unzip the packages make sure to edit the following command if you have downloaded different version you can type _ls_ if you are not sure for the file name

```shell
tar xzf hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz
```
