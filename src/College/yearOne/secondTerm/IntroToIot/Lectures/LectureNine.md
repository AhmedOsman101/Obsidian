# Introduction to IoT - Lecture 9: IOT Protocols

## IoT Protocols Overview

IoT protocols are essential for enabling secure and efficient communication between devices. They support four fundamental components:

- **Device**
- **Connectivity**
- **Data**
- **Analytics**

## IoT Protocol Stack

A conceptual model that outlines how various IoT protocols operate across layers, including:

- Application Layer
- Transport Layer
- Network Layer
- Link/Physical Layer

## IoT vs. Internet Protocol Stack

While both stacks aim to enable data communication, IoT stacks are optimized for:

- Lower power consumption
- Intermittent connectivity
- Real-time and lightweight operations

## Types of IoT Protocols

IoT protocols can be broadly classified into:

1. **Network Protocols**: Handle device communication.
2. **Data Protocols**: Handle how data is formatted and transmitted.

## IoT Network Protocols

### Bluetooth and BLE

- **Bluetooth**: Used for short-range (2.4 GHz) communication.
- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**: Optimized for IoT with low power and extended range (up to 150m).
- **Latest version**: Bluetooth 5.3 (as of July 2021).

### Cellular (4G/5G)

- **4G**: High-speed but power-hungry, less ideal for IoT.
- **5G**: Better suited for IoT due to low latency and high capacity.

### Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi HaLow

- **Wi-Fi (802.11n)**: Popular but power-intensive.
- **Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah)**: IoT-optimized with longer range and lower power consumption.

### LPWANs (Low Power Wide Area Networks)

- Used for long-range, low-power IoT applications.
- **Protocols**: LoRaWAN, 6LoWPAN, Thread, NB-IoT, LTE-M, SigFox, Hay
