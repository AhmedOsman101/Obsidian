## 7. What is the maximum number that we can count up to using 10 bits?

**General rule:** $2^{bits} - 1$

$2^{10} - 1 = 1023$

<br><br>

## 8. What is the maximum number that we can count up to using 14 bits?

$2^{14} - 1 = 16383$

## 9. How many bits are needed to count up to a maximum of 511?

**General rule:** $\lceil \log_2(max) \rceil$ -> Ceil the log2 of the maximum.

$2^n - 1 = 511, \space 2^n = 512, \space n = 9$ or $\log_2(512) = 9$

## 10. How many bits are needed to count up to a maximum of 63?

$2^n - 1 = 63, \space 2^n = 64, \space n = 6$ or $\log_2(64) = 6$

## 11. Draw the timing diagram for a digital signal that continuously alternates between 0.2 V (binary 0) for 2 ms and 4.4 V (binary 1) for 4 ms.

## 12. Draw the timing diagram for a signal that alternates between 0.3 V (binary 0) for 5 ms and 3.9 V (binary 1) for 2 ms.

## 13. Suppose that the decimal integer values from 0 to 15 are to be transmitted in binary.

0. Numbers $0$ to $15$ are represented by 4 bits ($2^4 = 16$).
1. How many lines will be needed if parallel representation is used?
   - Parallel representation sends all bits simultaneously (at the same time), each on its own separate line.
   - That means it would use **4 Lines**.
2. How many will be needed if serial representation is used?
   - Serial representation sends all bits sequentially one after the other, using a single line.
   - It would use **1 Line**.

## 14. How is a microprocessor different from a microcomputer?

### Microprocessor

- A microprocessor is a single processor core that fetches, decodes, and executes instructions.
- It requires external memory (ROM/RAM), a memory decoder, an oscillator, and I/O ports to form a complete microcomputer.
- Handles arithmetic, logic, and control operations — cannot operate alone.

### Microcomputer

- A complete computer system built around a microprocessor.
- Consists of the **microprocessor + memory (RAM/ROM) + I/O ports + storage + power supply**, etc.
- Fully functional — capable of running programs and performing tasks independently.

## 15. How is a microcontroller different from a microcomputer?

### Microcontroller

- A microcontroller is a compact system-on-chip (SoC) with an integrated CPU, memory (RAM, ROM), and programmable I/O peripherals, designed for specific tasks.
- Used for dedicated control tasks in embedded systems (e.g., washing machines, sensors, robotics).
- Optimized for **control and efficiency**, not high-speed computing.

### Microcomputer

- A **complete general-purpose computing system** that may use a microprocessor or microcontroller as its CPU.
- Used for general-purpose computing (e.g., personal computers, workstations).
- Optimized for **flexibility** and **processing power**.
