# The Driver Watches the Road, but the Passenger Sees It

While going on a road trip what the driver sees is so different than what the passenger sees, although they're looking at the same road and the same landscape. That's because the driver is only busy watching the road, always focused on seeing other cars, pedestrians crossing the road and many other things, that makes him only seeing a small part of the road. On the other hand the passenger sees the road with no worries, he can simply enjoy watching the landscape around him, appreciating every small detail, he can take his time to see the beauty of the surroundings.

It's the same thing in life, we are all the time viewing our life from the driver's perspective, rushed and unfocused, only seeing what's coming forward without a chance to look back at what happened a moment ago. We must look into our life from a passenger's perspective, review what you've done with your life until now, what have you achieved, what's your purpose and are you living to that purpose or not. All of these questions a driver can't answer or he will simply say yes without thinking, while the passenger will give a thoughtful answer after seeing what he has done and what he has achieved.

That idea came clear to me after watching "Soul" movie, the main character "Joe Gardner"
